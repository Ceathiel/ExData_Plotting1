## Introduction

This assignment uses data from
the <a href="http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/">UC Irvine Machine
Learning Repository</a>, a popular repository for machine learning
datasets. In particular, we will be using the "Individual household
electric power consumption Data Set" which I have made available on
the course web site:


* <b>Dataset</b>: <a href="https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/exdata%2Fdata%2Fhousehold_power_consumption.zip">Electric power consumption</a> [20Mb]

* <b>Description</b>: Measurements of electric power consumption in
one household with a one-minute sampling rate over a period of almost
4 years. Different electrical quantities and some sub-metering values
are available.


## How to use the submitted R scripts

Prior to running any of the submitted R scripts, please ensure that the file "household_power_consumption.txt" is unzipped from the dataset and is available in your working directory.

This assignment submission contains the ff. scipts below which should be sourced into your session:

* plot1.R - contains a function that produces the 1st plot by running plot1()
* plot2.R - contains a function that produces the 2nd plot by running plot2()
* plot3.R - contains a function that produces the 3rd plot by running plot3()
* plot4.R - contains a function that produces the 4th plot by running plot4()
